* Deliverables
** Team
  - [ ] Markdown / web content documenting and demonstrating your band
  - [ ] Information including bill of materials, wiring schematics, mechanical drawings, well-documented code, etc. necessary to recreate the system
  - [ ] Describe the construction and operation of the instruments using pictures, videos, and text descriptions.
  - [ ] Webpage documenting and demonstrating your band and its constituent instruments
    + Details and videos of various subsystems, and instructions for user interaction
  - [ ] Generate figures demonstrating relationship between the sensed quantities and the sensor output
    + graph, a timing diagram, or a table of values, etc.
  - [ ] Demonstration of Multi-Robot collaboration (instruments performing in harmony)
  - [ ] Record a live performance and include in the documentation
** Individual
   - [ ] Specific individual contributions into an academic poster
     1) key methods and results
     2) How each element works
     3) Detail design process and any design decision
     4) Potential alternatives and areas for further development
     5) Include any relevant links to webpages
     6) Upload a .pdf by <2018-02-08 Thu 16:00>
* Lab Specification
** Making Noise
  - At least two different instruments each driven by separate microcontroller
** Sensing environment and users
  - At least two different kinds of sensors
** Multi-Robot collaboration
   - Sensors measurements need to be used for instruments to collaborate explicitly with each other
** User Interface
   - User interaction through a web-based user interface, hosted on microcontroller or on a separate server with links to command the microcontrollers
   - Free to choose options to provide the users (start/stop or select song or set tempo, full control programming the music)
